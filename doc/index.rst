###TRIQS
Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum Systems is a set of C++ and Python libraries for the study of interacting quantum systems.

###Python & C++

TRIQS is composed of libraries in two languages: 1. Python libraries implement the most common many-body objects, like Greenâ€™s functions, in user-friendly scripts. 2. C++ libraries enable users to quickly develop high-performance low-level codes

This duality is a real advantage in the development of new many-body tools. Critical parts where performance is essential can be written in C++ (e.g. a quantum impurity solver) while data analysis, preparation of inputs or interface with other programs can be handled in more user-friendly Python scripts.
