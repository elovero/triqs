    <div>Python & C++ TRIQS is composed of libraries in two languages:</div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Python libraries implement the most common many-body objects, like
        Greenâ€™s functions, in user-friendly scripts.
      </li>
      <li>
        C++ libraries enable users to quickly develop high-performance low-level
        codes This duality is a real advantage in the development of new
        many-body tools. Critical parts where performance is essential can be
        written in C++ (e.g. a quantum impurity solver) while data analysis,
        preparation of inputs or interface with other programs can be handled in
        more user-friendly Python scripts.
